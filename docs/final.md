## Video
[Use a level two header at the very top, and embed the video of your project using the YouTube embed
video option. Specifically, go to your video on YouTube, then click on Share, then Embed, and copy-paste
the code in final.md . As in the status report, the video should contain a brief problem description (using
images, screenshots, or screen captures), an example capture of how a simple baseline performs, and an
example capture of a run that is your best. You are free to include more details, such as summary of how you
did it, some of the failure cases, but it is not needed. The video should be a maximum of three minutes
(less is fine), of reasonably high quality, i.e. a minimum resolution of 1200 ×720 (i.e. 720p), and speech, if
any, should be comprehensible.]
## Project Summary
[ Use another level-two header to start a Project Summary section. Write a few paragraphs
summarizing the goals of the project (yes, yet again, but updated/improved version from the status). In
particular, make sure that the problem is clearly defined here, and feel free to use an image or so to set up
the task. Part of the evaluation will be on how well you are able to motivate the challenges of the problem,
i.e. why it is not trivial, and why you need AI/ML algorithms to solve it.]
## Approaches
[Use another level-two header called Approaches, In this section, describe both the baselines
and your proposed approach(es). Describe precisely what the advantages and disadvantages of each are,
for example, why one might be more accurate, need less data, take more time, overfit, and so on. Include
enough technical information to be able to (mostly) reproduce your project, in particular, use pseudocode
and equations as much as possible.]
## Evaluation
[An important aspect of your project, is evaluating your project. Be clear and precise about
describing the evaluation setup, for both quantitative and qualitative results. Present the results to convince
the reader that you have solved the problem, to whatever extent you claim you have. Use plots, charts, tables,
screenshots, figures, etc. as needed. I expect you will need at least a few paragraphs to describe each type of
evaluation that you perform.]
## References
[Make a list of work you’re citing in your description above (starting with a level-two header).
This should include any papers you think are relevant, third-party source code you used, sources for any of
the images that you didn’t create, and any other websites/links you found useful.]
