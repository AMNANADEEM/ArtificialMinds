### Project Summary

Duckietown is an interactive platform for developing and evaluating algorithms for autonomous driving tasks like Lane Following alongside other vehicles and/or pedestrians. The goal of our project was to train an agent (a duckie bot) to drive on the right side of the street while avoiding pedestrians. Because of time constraints and challenges that arose, the updated goal is to train an agent to drive on a street following one lane (basic lane following). The input from the Duckietown simulator is an image in the form of a NumPy array for each timestep. The output from our agent is a pair of motor commands specifying the velocity and direction that our duckie bot should follow for each timestep. Currently with the DDPG algorithm, the agent does not train well and we are planning on tuning hyperparameters and the reward function to improve upon the algorithm to reach our goal.
